## Bio

I'm a graduate student studying computational linguistics. I'm interested in NLP for low-resource languages, and the curation of high-quality datasets.

## Projects
This section will be filled in as I collect my code :\)

- [ViPER](https://github.com/jekhi5/ViPER-compiler): A simple functional programming language with unit testing. Compiler hosted in `OCaml` targeting `x86_64` assembly with a `C` runtime. 
- [NLP Games](https://github.com/ThePineappleW/NLPgames): A collection of toys illustrating various NLP tools and concepts. Includes Twenty Questions using WordNet, and an ontological Connections generator.

## Hobbies

- I enjoy word games, in particular constructing and solving crossword puzzles.
- I love learning languages. Some of my favorites are Finnish, Hebrew, Scottish Gaelic, and Sumerian.
- In spite of my general clumsiness, I've learned a handful of yo-yo tricks.
- I'm in the high 99th percentile of users on [JetPunk](https://www.jetpunk.com).
